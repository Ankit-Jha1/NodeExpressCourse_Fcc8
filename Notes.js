/* Node js Notes


    - No window 
        means we will never write “document.querySelector”

    - Versions 
        - Node js app can run in a certain version, we do not need to update it(might give bugs if we do), 
        - but if built for browsers, the browser can upgrade and can break the app

    - node has 2 versions
        - REPL
            - type "node" in terminal and go to REPL mode 
        - CLI
